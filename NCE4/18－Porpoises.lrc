[00:02.80]Porpoises|鼠海豚
[00:09.00]What would you say is the main characteristic of porpoises?|你认为海豚的主要特征是什么？
[00:15.63]There has long been a superstition among mariners that porpoises will save drowning men by pushing them to the surface,|长期以来，水手们一直有一种迷信：海豚会通过将溺水者推向水面来拯救他们。
[00:23.59]or protect them from sharks by surrounding them in defensive formation.|或者通过形成防御阵型来保护它们免受鲨鱼的攻击。
[00:29.17]Marine Studio biologists have pointed out that, however intelligent they may be,|海洋工作室的生物学家指出，无论它们多么聪明，
[00:34.75]it is probably a mistake to credit dolphins with any motive of life-saving.|将海豚的行为归因于“拯救生命”的动机，很可能是一种错误的看法。
[00:40.59]On the occasions when they have pushed to shore an unconscious human being they have much more likely done it out of curiosity or for sport,|在它们将失去意识的人推向岸边的那些情况下，它们这么做很可能是出于好奇心或为了玩耍，
[00:49.66]as in riding the bow waves of a ship.|就像它们喜欢乘着船头浪一样。
[00:53.49]In 1928 some porpoises were photographed working like beavers to push ashore a waterlogged mattress.|1928年，有人拍到了一些海豚正在像海狸一样辛勤地工作，将一个被水浸透的床垫推上岸。
[01:01.70]If, as has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks,|如果真如报道所说，它们确实保护过人类免受鲨鱼攻击，
[01:06.35]it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks.|可能是因为好奇心驱使他们前来，也可能是食物的气味吸引了那些鲨鱼。
[01:14.03]Porpoises and sharks are natural enemies.|海豚和鲨鱼是天生的敌人。
[01:17.32]It is possible that upon such an occasion a battle ensued, with the sharks being driven away or killed.|在这种情况下，很可能会发生一场战斗：鲨鱼们要么被驱赶走，要么被杀死。
[01:24.97]Whether it be bird, fish or beast, the porpoise is intrigued with anything that is alive.|无论是鸟、鱼还是兽，鼠海豚对所有活物都着迷。
[01:31.85]They are constantly after the turtles, who peacefully submit to all sorts of indignities.|它们总是追逐海龟，而海龟则温顺地忍受着各种戏弄。
[01:37.78]One young calf especially enjoyed raising a turtle to the surface with his snout,|有一只小海豚特别喜欢用鼻子把海龟顶到水面，
[01:43.53]and then shoving him across the tank like an aquaplane.|然后像推动水上滑板一样把他推过那个水箱。
[01:48.38]Almost any day a young porpoises may be seen trying to turn a 300-pound sea turtle over by sticking his snout under the edge of his shell and pushing up for dear life.|几乎每天都能看到小海豚试图把一只300磅重的海龟翻个底朝天：它们把鼻子伸到海龟壳边缘，拼尽全力往上顶。
[02:00.82]This is not easy, and may require two porpoises working together.|这并不容易，可能需要两只海豚共同协作才能完成。
[02:06.35]In another game, as the turtle swims across the oceanarium, the first porpoise swoops down from above and butts his shell with his belly.|在另一个游戏中，当海龟游过海洋馆时，第一只海豚从上方俯冲下来，用腹部撞击龟壳。
[02:16.45]This knocks the turtle down several feet.|这一撞把海龟撞下去好几英尺。
[02:19.67]He no sooner recovers his equilibrium than the next porpoises comes along and hits him another crack.|它刚恢复平衡，下一只海豚就过来又撞了一下。
[02:27.25]Eventually the turtle has been butted all the way down to the floor of the tank.|最后海龟被一路撞到了水族箱底部。
[02:33.07]He is now satisfied merely to try to stand up, but as soon as he does so a porpoise knocks him flat.|这时海龟只求能站起来，可刚一站起来，海豚就又把它撞翻了。
[02:41.12]The turtle at last gives up by pulling his feet under his shell and the game is over.|海龟最终放弃，把脚缩进壳里，游戏就此结束。
