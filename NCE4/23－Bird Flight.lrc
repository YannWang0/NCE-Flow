[00:40.10]without visible or more than occasional movement of wing.|翅膀没有明显的运动，或者仅有偶尔的轻微摆动。
[00:45.71]The currents of air that the walls of the ship direct upwards,|那些被船体墙壁引导向上的气流……
[00:50.11]as well as in the line of its course,|以及沿着船只航行的方向，

[01:16.22]It comes nearer to the engines with which man has 'conquered' the air, as he boasts.|它越来越接近那些人类用来“征服”天空的飞行器了——正如人类所自豪地宣称的那样。
[01:22.79]Duck, and like them the pigeons, are endowed with steel-like muscles,|鸭子，和鸽子一样，拥有像钢铁一样强健的肌肉。
[01:30.24]that are a good part of the weight of the bird,|这些部分占据了鸟类体重的很大比例。
[01:33.32]and these will ply the short wings with such irresistible power|能以不可抗拒的力量驱动短小的翅膀，
[01:38.48]that they can bore for long distances through an opposing gale|顶着逆风长距离飞行，
[01:43.04]before exhaustion follows.|直到精疲力竭。

[02:06.53]It tires not, nor does it boast of its power; but belongs to the air|它不会感到疲劳，也不会夸耀自己的力量；
[02:13.01]travelling it may be six thousand miles to and from its northern nesting home,|往返于六千英里外的北方巢穴之间，
[02:18.95]feeding its flown young as it flies, and slipping through a medium|一边飞行一边喂养已经会飞的雏鸟，
[02:23.37]that seems to help its passage even when the wind is adverse.|穿行于似乎能助其前行的空气中，即使风向不利。
[02:28.78]Such birds do us good,|这样的鸟类对我们大有裨益，
[02:30.91]though we no longer take omens from their flight on this side and that;|尽管我们不再从它们忽东忽西的飞行中解读预兆了；
[02:36.29]and even the most superstitious villagers no longer take off their hats to the magpie and wish it good-morning.|就连最迷信的村民，也不会再向喜鹊脱帽道早安了。
