[00:20.97]Many people in industry and the Services,|那些对噪音有实际经验的人
[00:24.92]who have practical experience of noise,|那些具有处理噪声问题实际经验的人
[00:28.11]regard any investigation of this question as a waste of time;|认为对这个问题进行任何调查都是浪费时间；
[00:33.52]they are not prepared even to admit the possibility that noise affects people.|他们甚至不愿意承认“噪音会影响人们”这一可能性。
[00:39.59]On the other hand,|另一方面，
[00:41.14]those who dislike noise will sometimes use most inadequate evidence|那些不喜欢噪音的人，有时会使用非常不充分的证据
[00:46.05]to support their pleas for a quieter society.|以支持他们关于营造一个更加宁静社会的诉求。
[00:51.24]This is a pity, because noise abatement really is a good cause,|这真是太遗憾了，因为减少噪音确实是一个非常有益的事业（或：减少噪音是一件很有意义的事情）。
[00:57.25]and it is likely to be discredited if it gets to be associated with bad science.|如果这种理论或方法与糟糕的科学实践（即不严谨、不科学的研究方法）联系在一起，它很可能会被人们质疑或否定（即失去可信度）。

[01:37.86]until eventually she had to go into a mental hospital.|直到最后，她不得不被送进精神病院。
[01:42.71]Now the snag in this sort of anecdote is of course that one cannot distinguish cause and effect.|当然，这类轶事的一个问题在于人们无法区分其中的因果关系（即哪些事件是原因，哪些是结果）。
[01:50.45]Was the noise a cause of the illness,|这种噪音是导致疾病的原因吗？
[01:53.18]or were the complaints about noise merely a symptom?|还是说，那些关于噪音的投诉只是一种症状？

[02:00.30]that her neighbours were combining to slander her and persecute her,|说她的邻居们联合起来诽谤她、迫害她

[02:17.17]to discover whether they are mentally ill more often than other people are.|为了查明他们是否比普通人更容易患上精神疾病。

[02:36.39]It can be unpleasant to live even several miles from an aerodrome;|即使住在离机场几英里远的地方，也可能很不愉快；
[02:41.67]if you think what it must be like to share the deck of a ship with several squadrons of jet aircraft,|如果你想象一下：与几支喷气式飞机中队共享同一艘船的甲板，那会是什么样子……
[02:48.60]you will realize that a modern navy is a good place to study noise.|你会发现，现代海军是一个研究噪声问题的理想场所。
[02:54.98]But neither psychiatric interviews nor objective tests|但无论是精神病学访谈还是客观测试
[02:59.61]were able to show any effects upon these American sailors.|都未能显示对这些美国水手有任何影响。
[03:04.41]This result merely confirms earlier American and British studies:|这一结果仅仅证实了此前美国和英国的研究结果而已。
[03:09.99]if there is any effect of noise upon mental health,|如果噪音对心理健康有任何影响的话……
[03:13.90]it must be so small that present methods of psychiatric diagnosis cannot find it.|它一定非常微小，以至于现有的精神疾病诊断方法无法检测到它。
[03:22.54]That does not prove that it does not exist; but it does mean|这并不能证明该事物根本不存在；不过这确实意味着……

[03:33.72]--which really is a mental health hazard.|——那才真正是精神健康的危害。
