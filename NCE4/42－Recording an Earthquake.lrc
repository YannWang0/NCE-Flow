[00:02.45]Recording an earthquake|记录地震
[00:09.95]What does a pen have to do to record on paper the vibrations generated by an earthquake?|一支笔要如何才能在纸上记录下地震产生的震动呢？
[00:18.95]An earthquake comes like a thief in the night, without warning.|地震就像夜间的小偷一样，毫无预兆地突然降临。
[00:23.69]It was necessary, therefore, to invent instruments that neither slumbered nor slept.|因此，有必要发明那些既不会打盹也不会睡觉的仪器。
[00:29.84]Some devices were quite simple.|有些设备的设计非常简单。
[00:32.36]One, for instance, consisted of rods of various lengths and thicknesses which would stand up on end like ninepins.|例如，其中有一个装置由长度和厚度各不相同的杆子组成；这些杆子可以像九柱戏（ninepins）中的柱子一样竖立起来。
[00:41.06]When a shock came, it shook the rigid table upon which these stood.|当震动来临时，它震动了这些杆子所放置的坚硬桌子。
[00:46.36]If it were gentle, only the more unstable rods fell.|如果震动轻微，只有较不稳定的杆子会倒下。
[00:51.17]If it were severe, they all fell.|如果震动剧烈，它们就全部倒下。
[00:53.99]Thus the rods, by falling, and by the direction in which they fell,|因此，这些杆子通过倒下以及倒下的方向，
[00:58.85]recorded for the slumbering scientist the strength of a shock that was too weak to waken him,|为那位正在沉睡的科学家记录下了那次冲击的强度——不过那次冲击实在太微弱了，根本无法将他唤醒。
[01:05.70]and the direction from which it came.|以及它来自的方向。
[01:08.99]But instruments far more delicate than that were needed if any really serious advance was to be made.|但是，如果要取得真正重大的进展，就需要使用比那些仪器更加精密的设备。
[01:15.87]The ideal to be aimed at was to devise an instrument that could record with a pen on paper,|理想的目标是设计出一种能用笔在纸上记录的仪器，
[01:22.77]the movements of the ground or of the table as the quake passed by.|记录地震经过时地面或桌子的运动。
[01:28.24]While I write my pen moves, but the paper keeps still.|当我写字时，笔在动，但纸却静止不动。
[01:32.57]With practice, no doubt, I could in time learn to write by holding the pen still while the paper moved.|毫无疑问，通过练习，我最终能学会保持笔不动而让纸动来写字。
[01:39.75]That sounds a silly suggestion,|那听起来真是个愚蠢的建议。
[01:42.31]but that was precisely the idea adopted in some of the early instruments (seismometers) for recording earthquake waves.|但这正是某些早期地震仪在记录地震波时所采用的设计理念。
[01:51.70]But when table, penholder and paper are all moving, how is it possible to write legibly?|但是当桌子、笔架和纸张都在移动时，怎么可能还能写出清晰可读的文字呢？
[01:59.02]The key to a solution of that problem lay in an everyday observation.|解决那个问题的关键在于一个日常的观察结果。
[02:04.18]Why does a person standing in a bus or train tend to fall when a sudden start is made?|为什么当公交车或火车突然启动时，站在上面的人容易摔倒呢？
[02:10.59]It is because his feet move on, but his head stays still.|这是因为他的脚向前移动，而头部却保持静止。
[02:15.18]A simple experiment will help us a little further.|一个简单的实验能帮助我们进一步理解这个原理。
[02:18.39]Tie a heavy weight at the end of a long piece of string.|在一段较长的绳子末端系上一个重物。
[02:22.24]With the hand held high in the air, hold the string so that the weight nearly touches the ground.|将绳子高高举过头顶，使重物几乎触碰到地面。
[02:28.78]Now move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down.|现在让手前后左右移动，但不要上下移动。
[02:33.76]It will be found that the weight moves but slightly or not at all.|你会发现重物几乎不动，或者只轻微移动。
[02:38.34]Imagine a pen attached to the weight in such a way that its point rests upon a piece of paper on the floor.|想象一下，有一支笔被固定在重物上，其笔尖接触着地面上的一张纸。
[02:44.93]Imagine an earthquake shock shaking the floor, the paper, you and your hand.|再想象一场地震，地震使地面、纸张以及你的手都在震动。
[02:51.42]In the midst of all this movement, the weight and the pen would be still.|在所有这些运动中，重物和笔会保持静止。
[02:55.97]But as the paper moved from side to side under the pen point, its movement would be recorded in ink upon its surface.|但当纸张在笔尖下左右移动时，它的运动就会以墨迹记录在纸面上。
[03:04.18]It was upon this principle that the first instruments were made, but the paper was wrapped round a drum which rotated slowly.|最早的测量仪器就是基于这个原理制造的——只不过当时的纸张是缠绕在一个缓慢旋转的鼓上的。
[03:13.20]As long as all was still, the pen drew a straight line,|当一切保持静止时，笔会画出一条直线；
[03:17.64]but while the drum was being shaken, the line that the pen was drawing wriggled from side to side.|但当鼓被震动时，笔所画的线就会左右摆动。
[03:25.18]The apparatus thus described, however,|然而，上面描述的装置
[03:27.85]records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, which is, in fact, much more complicated.|只能记录波动的水平分量，而实际上波动要复杂得多。
[03:35.21]If we could actually see the path described by a particle,|如果我们能真的看到粒子所描绘的路径，
[03:39.21]such as a sand grain in the rock,|就像岩石中的一粒沙子一样……
[03:41.95]it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing round the room; it would be up and down, to and fro and from side to side.|它会更像一只绿头苍蝇在房间里嗡嗡飞舞：上下、前后、左右地移动。
[03:50.54]Instruments have been devised and can be so placed that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs.|已经设计出可以适当放置的仪器，从而能将这三个要素记录在不同的图表上。
[03:58.84]When the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre,|当该仪器距离地震中心超过700英里时，
[04:04.62]the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after the other at short intervals.|图纸上会显示出三列波以较短的时间间隔相继到达。
[04:10.63]The first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations.|第一列波记录了纵向振动的到达。
[04:15.56]The second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first.|第二列波标志着横向振动的到达；这些振动传播较慢，在第一列波到达几分钟后才传来。
[04:25.16]These two have travelled through the earth.|这两列波已经穿过地球。
[04:27.87]It was from the study of these that so much was learnt about the interior of the earth.|正是通过研究这两列波，人类才对地球内部有了如此多的了解。
[04:33.66]The third, or main wave is the slowest and has travelled round the earth through the surface rocks.|第三列波即主波传播最慢，它是通过地表岩石环绕地球传播的。
